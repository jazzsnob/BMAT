# BMAT
A python script for uploading db_works_test.csv data to MongoDB, as well as querying for right owners metadata by ISWC.
## Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Copy and past the connection string into the code (line 65), within the double quotes of MongoClient("**connection string**"):
```
cluster = MongoClient("mongodb+srv://bmatUser:<password>@cluster0.rtjcd.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority")
```
Replace ```<password>``` with the password for the ```bmatUser``` user. Replace ```<dbname>``` with the name of the database that connections will use by default.

```
python bmat.py db_works_test.csv -u
